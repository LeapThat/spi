<h1>Technology should be simple - methodology</h1>

Complication meter - SPI -We have developed an internal meter that looks on the user experience as a Simple as Possible Interface (SPI in the rest of this document) and counted each screen redirect as 10 points, each button to push 20 points, each action to be done 30 points and each choice to make 50. Login process will cost 70 PSI (name, password and button) under this meter for example.
Under that perspective there are three main features to reduce SPI points-

Integrations - Using existing API’s the user needs only to login (or just press a logo) in order to create a website. Social networks and business directories data is stored in an accessible format and easy to reformat by custom scripts to a modern template. (website creation SPI costs- 30 SPI- one click if logged in, and redirect to new site -100 PSI- if requires login)
Web crawler - For using a website as a content source the user will have to copy a URL and paste it to a designated field in the Leapthat app. The website HTML/CSS format holds the data in an easy and mostly standard structure that he app will know to rearrange in a modern template. (website creation SPI costs- 110 SPI- Copy and paste URL and press go)
Automation - In order to prevent any user choices or other features damaging PSI rank we’ve developd the following automations:
Application side- LeapThat application engine has many analysis and identification scripts that rearrange the data given based on font size, location, keywords and many more.
External analysis tools- LeapThat application uses Google and Amazon services in order to analyse user content, label it. This services analyse images and texts and the LeapThat algorithm uses those in order to better understand user content type, atmosphere and purpose. This allows a PSI free design process so the end result will be as close to user intent as possible and require the user no further alterations.
